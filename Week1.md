### vanilla javascript = pure JS

## Library

- A software library gives you a well-defined collection of implementations or repeated behaviors that you can use to quickly implement complicated applications.
- This is where the reuse of behavior is of paramount importance for us (reuse)
- Modularity : JQuery

## Framework

- Abstraction in which software provides generic functionality that can be selectively changed by additional user-written code (Angul b ar)
